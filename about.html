			1. <b><a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/kochi">Kochi</a>  </b> <br>
			<b>What is it? </b> Per se alum chef Sungchul Shim’s $135 nine-course tasting of skewers inspired by Korean royal court cuisine. A sool pairing is also available for $95. Kochi first opened in 2019 and was recently awarded a Michelin star. Shim followed its success with five-star restaurant Mari late last year.
				<br>
			<b>Why We Love it? </b> Ordering everything on the menu is usually relegated to daydreams, but at Kochi, it’s possible. Courses include items like charcoal grilled Spanish mackerel and braised short rib. 
			<br>
			2. <b> <a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/crown-shy">Crown Shy</a> </b><br>
			<b>What is it?</b> This 2019 opening was longtime chef de cuisine at Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park James Kent’s first 
			solo venture. Crown Shy still turns out excellent food and beautiful cocktails in an elegant environment that’s equal parts
			special occasion destination and nicer-than-normal evening whim. Its upstairs neighbor Overstory is also sensational for drinks with a view after dinner.<br>

			<b>Why we love it? </b> Crown Shy feels important without being intimidating. It’s a this-must-be-the-place kind of spot that manages to remain warm and inviting. We're 
			especially fond of the gruyère fritters, roasted short rib, and regally garnished Crown cocktails. <br>
			
			3. <b><a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/dhamaka"> Dhamaka </a> </b><br>
			<b>What is it? </b>  NYC’s dazzling best new restaurant of 2021 with dishes seldom seen on local menus. <br>

			<b>Why we love it? </b> The unstoppable Unapologetic Foods team spotlights what they refer to as “the forgotten side of India,” including gurda
			 kapoora (goat kidney, testicles, red onion and pao) doh khleh (pork with lime, cilantro, onion and ginger) and champaran meat (mutton, garlic, red chili). 
			 The group has continued opening new venues since Dhamaka, including Rowdy Rooster, which serves
			 the best new fried chicken sandwich in NYC. See its coming attractions on our list of the most anticipated restaurant openings of fall, 2022. 
			<br>
			4. <b><a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/gage-tollner">Gage Tollner </a> </b>	<br>
			<b>What is it? </b> Long the stuff of legend, Gage & Tollner had a previous iteration as one of Brooklyn’s most glittering restaurants before 
			its gilded space ceased operation in 2004 after more than a century. A trio of Brooklyn hospitality pros got to work reviving it a baker’s dozen years
			 later and, after a pause in 2020, Gage & Tollner is finally open for business once more.
			<br>
			<b>Why we love it?  </b>Gage & Tollner’s previous projected opening date of March 15, 2020 was plenty buzzy back then, and the wait only further tickled anticipation.
			The space is as lovely as we thought it would be, with hearty, decadent menu offerings repete with occasional throwbacks. Bar seats are reserved for walk-ins, which 
			makes getting in a tick easier. Gage & Tollner is also NYC Summer 
			Restaurant Week's top participating spot. And check out Sunken Harbor Club upstairs, too, if you get the chance.<br>
			5. <b><a href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/rezdora">Rezdora </a> </b>	<br>
			<b> What is it?</b> After a turn at Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, which was ranked 2018’s best restaurant in the world, chef Stefano Secchi
			went on to open one of NYC's best restaurants the following year. 
			<br>
			<b>Why we love it? </b> Dinner at Rezdôra feels like a new culinary experience even for people who grew up on pasta night. Individual plates
 			are available, but its $98 regional pasta tasting is an exciting tour of the restaurant's 
			best. Prime time reservations are still tough to acquire, but you should be able to ease in for weekday lunch.
